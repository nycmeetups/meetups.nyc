      <p>We're a meetup group in and around New York City, with members coming from all walks of life. We're an unofficial Discord server that's adopted the core idea from the Reddit New York City meetup group <a href="http://reddit.com/r/nycmeetups">nycmeetups</a> - a big thank you to the original nycmeetups admins for their hard work in maintaining the official Discord until the end! With the dissolution of the official nycmeetups Discord, our goal is to offer an unofficial and unaffiliated platform to discuss meetups in NYC. We want to provide a safe, friendly, and open Discord community to organize and attend meetups in and around NYC.</p>
      <p>Our members meet up to:
        <ul>
          <li>Attend museums and other attractions</li>
          <li>Try out interesting restaurants</li>
          <li>Walk around the city</li>
          <li>Grab a +1 for an impromtpu meetup</li>
          <li>To make friends!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>We are following the CDC guidelines for social distancing and require all members to adhere to a code of conduct.</p>
